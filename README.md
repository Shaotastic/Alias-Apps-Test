# Alias-Apps-Test
Version is Unity 2019.4.28f1

 
-	Main.scene will have the test.

-	In the main scene there will be a object called Game_Object_Collection with a script, same name, 
	will have three variables:
	
		Node Name: 	Just finds the a node with the following name, in this case the node "game_object"
	
		Node Names: the game_object node has three nodes; type, script, position. This approach I believe is more dynamic when
					trying to add more/remove nodes 
	
		Scripts:	Used to reference the scripts needed
